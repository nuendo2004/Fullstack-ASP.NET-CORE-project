                              Some third party sites and apps allow us to reach
                              our users with online promotions about our titles
                              and services by sending a privacy protective
                              identifier to the third party. A privacy
                              protective identifier means we convert the
                              original information (such as an email address or

                              information from being revealed. The third party
                              compares the privacy protective identifier to
                              identifiers in its database and there will be a
                              match only if you have used the same identifier
                              (such as an email address) with Immersed and the
                              third party. If there is a match, Immersed can
                              then choose whether or not to send a given
                              promotionsal communication to you on that third
                              party site or app, and can optimize and better
