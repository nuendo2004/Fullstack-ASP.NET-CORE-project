                If you opt out of advertising cookies, you may still see
                Immersed ads on other sites, but those ads will not be
                customized by us or our service providers and we will continue
                to customize your experience on our website via our use of
                cookies you have not refused.

                Alternatively, privacy settings in most browsers will allow you
                to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have it
                notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies
                altogether. If your browser is set to not accept any cookies,
                you will not receive Interest-Based Advertising, but your use of
                the Immersed service may be impaired or unavailable. In
                addition, if you use our cookie tool to opt-out of certain
                cookies, your opt-out preferences will be remembered by placing
                a cookie on your device. It is therefore important that your
                browser is configured to accept cookies for your preferences to
                take effect. If you delete or clear your cookies, or if you
                change which web browser you are using, you will need to set
                your cookie preferences again.
